# Ducky FAQ

## Why did you make Ducky?

# I wanted to play with some natural language processing tools and techniques and also make a bot that grapples with some ethical consideration.

## What can Ducky do?

# Ducky specializes in largely domain specific conversation related to coding, computers, and software development.

## Why is Ducky a Duck?

# Making Ducky a Rubber Ducky fits with the coding specific domain of the Slackbot. According to the [Wikipedia entry on Rubber Duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) "The name is a reference to a story in the book [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer) in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck."

# Additionally, making Ducky an inanimate object avoids the trends toward making bots that impersonate women or teenagers with the unfortunate implication that those kinds of people are easier to impersonate with a deeply imperfect bot because they are in some way not fully human.

## What ethical considerations did you have to take into account while making Ducky?

# There were two types of potential user input that were particularly of concern.

1) Deeply personal and/or serious input. Such as a user saying "I feel unsafe at home" or "I'm thinking about self-harm"

2) Offensive user input
